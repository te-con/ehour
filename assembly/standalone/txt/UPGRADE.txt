Upgrade instructions from previous version to ${pom.version}
---------------------------------------------------
Unpack the ${pom.version} archive in a new directory. Copy the ehourDb directory from the root of your previous eHour installation to the db directory of eHour 0.9.1. This is a different location that the one in 0.8.4.

Directory layout in eHour 0.8.4:
ehour-0.8.4/ehourDb

In 0.9.1:
ehour-0.9.1/db/ehourDb

That's it, start eHour as explained in the installation instructions.

Note: When you're running eHour as a Windows service, make sure you run the uninstallservice.bat of your old version first. This file can be found in the bin\windows-x86-32 directory. This will prevent your old version from starting when Windows boots.
