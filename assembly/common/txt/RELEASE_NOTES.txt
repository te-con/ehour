eHour 0.9.1 release notes (23 April 2011)
-----------------------------------------
eHour 0.9.1 adds MySQL and PostgreSQL support to the standalone version, enabling the standalone version to run in a production environment.

The concept of the eHour home directory is introduced. The home directory holds the log files and translations files are loaded from there. This allows you to improve or add translations in an easy fashion.

From the web UI, eHour's database can now be imported/exported from/to an external file. This export can be used as a backup file or to migrate between servers. The export file is database independent so an export from the 0.8.4 standalone database can be imported in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. The export requires at least Java 1.6.0_19.

A number of improvements were done on the UI. When there are unsaved hours in a timesheet and the user navigates away, a warning message will be shown. The main navigation is also improved.
