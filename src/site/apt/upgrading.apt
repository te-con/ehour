Upgrading

* Upgrade from v0.41 to v0.5
	
	A database update is needed which adds new tables and modifies the PROJECT and PROJECT_ASSIGNMENT table.
	
	Before performing the update it's wise to backup your database first. After the backup run the update.v_04x_to_v0_5.mysql.sql script
	which can be found in the sql directory. To do so execute the following command:
	
+--
	mysql ehour -u user -p < update.v_04x_to_v0_5.mysql.sql
+--	
	
	For the application, copy the ehour-0.5.war to your tomcat deploy directory. Edit <<conf/Catalina/localhost/ehour-tomcat.xml>> and
	update the version number of the war file in docBase to 0.5.
	
	After you restarted Tomcat and you still see v0.4 on the logon screen, delete the ehour directory in Tomcat's <<webapps>> dir.

	Two new configuration parameters are introduced in this version, <<Mail from>> and <<SMTP server>>. Login as
	an admin and go to the configurations page to change the values.

	If you get the error "Unknown column 'projectass0_.ROLE' in 'field list'" in your logfile after logging in, run
	the fix_v0.4_role.sql on your database:
	
+--
	mysql ehour -u user -p < fix_v0.4_role.sql
+--	
	

* Upgrade from v0.1 - v0.3 to v0.41

	A small database update is needed which adds some configuration keys.
	
	In the sql directory, run the update.to_v0_4.mysql.sql script against your existing eHour database to add these keys.
	
	For the application, copy the ehour-0.4.war to your tomcat deploy directory. Edit <<conf/Catalina/localhost/ehour-tomcat.xml>> and
	update the version number of the war file in docBase to 0.4.
	
	After you restarted Tomcat and you still see v0.3 on the logon screen, delete the ehour directory in Tomcat's <<webapps>>.

* Upgrade from v0.1 to v0.3, v0.2 to v0.3

	No database changes are needed, just replace the ehour.war in your tomcat deploy directory with the new one.

* Upgrade from v0.1 to v0.2

	No database changes are needed, just replace the ehour-test.war in your tomcat deploy directory with the new one.
