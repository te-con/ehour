Change Log

* 0.5 Release Notes

	Added project manager reports for projects that (s)he manages

	Added more contextual help in the admin sections with links to the main documentation

	Update documentation on website (www.ehour.nl/documentation.html)

	Removed the hide inactive users checkbox from the assignment form, it didn't make sense. Why
	would you assign a project to an inactive user anyway ? (admin)

	When assigning projects to users, customer and project code are displayed in the project dropdown (admin)
	
	Fixed the layout of the report criteria for users.

	Configurable SMTP server address and default mail from: added to eHour config

	A project can now have a project manager. PM's get warning messages with fixed/flex time allotted assignments.

	New authorization role (ROLE_PROJECTMANAGER) added. Users are automatically given (or revoked) a PM role, this role is not selectable when modifying or editing users.

	When a default project is assigned to a new user the "date" assignment
	type is used with an infinite start and end date. The default
	assignment has been removed.

	Start and end date for assignments aren't mandatory anymore so you now
	can have infinite assignments or assignments with a start date but no
	end date and vice versa.

	User filters in the admin section don't have a label anymore but the text is in the input box itself (a la google toolbar).

	To save horizontal space, in the user admin section the project role is not displayed behind the project anymore but shown as a tooltip

	Renamed project description to project role.

	Flex time alloted and Fixed time alloted assignment types added. See the documentation on www.ehour.nl as this
	was quite a change.

	Using a standard 'loading' animation rather than a loading message which is in a different location on every page

	Project duration and total booked and remaining hours shown on user's month overview

	On most pages icons are used rather than plain submit buttons (admin section)

	Customer and projectcode shown on user's month overview
